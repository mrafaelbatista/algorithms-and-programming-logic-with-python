# Algorithms and Python Programming Logic
### Messias R. Batista (@mrafaelbatista)


<p>Course of Algorithms and Programming Logic with the Python language. It is focus is simple codes, and present concepts to learn programming fundamentals.</p>

## About this repository

<p><strong>This is the repository of my class about algorithmics and programming logic.</strong> In this repository, you finding many codes which I use to teach in the degree courses.
I start classes to talk about logic, programming logic, and algorithmics. Next, I learn the initial steps on the programming of the Python language. For last, I make solutions with the students according to the contents of class topics.</p>

## Topics presented in the class / code:

<ul>
    <li>Fundamental of the construct of algorithms and programs</li>
    <li>Data types, variables, and constants</li>
    <li>Operators: arithmetic, relational, and logic</li>
    <li>Math expression, and formulas</li>
    <li>Control struct: sequetial, simple conditional branch, compound conditional branch</li>
    <li>Loop struct: while, and for</li>
    <li>Vectors and Matrix</li>
    <li>Subprograms</li>
</ul>

These files are made in Jupyter Notebook.
