# Algorithms and Python Programming Logic
### Messias R. Batista (@mrafaelbatista)

<br />
Course of Algorithms and Programming Logic with the Python language. It is focus is simple codes, and present concepts to learn programming fundamentals.

This is the repository of my class about algorithmics and programming logic. In this repository, you finding many codes which I use to teach in the degree courses.
I start classes to talk about logic, programming logic, and algorithmics. Next, I learn the initial steps on the programming of the Python language. For last, I make solutions with the students according to the contents of class topics.
Topics presented in the class:

Fundamental of the construct of algorithms and programs
Data types, variables, and constants
Operators: aritimetic, relational, and logic
Math expression, and formuls 
Control struct: sequetial, simple conditional branch, compound conditional branch
Loop struct: while, and for
Vectors and Matrix
Subprograms

These files are made in Jupyter Notebook.
